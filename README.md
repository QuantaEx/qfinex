## [QFinex](https://npro.nexbit.io) Introduction

QFinex is a free and open-source crypto-fiat API and matching engine implementation with the Rails framework.
This is a fork of Peatio designed for micro-services architecture. We have simplified the code
in order to use only QFinex API with external frontend and server components.

## Getting Started

NEXBIT.IO is a container distribution, the fastest way to install the full stack is using [nDAX](https://github.com/nexbitio/ndax)

```
# To install
git clone https://github.com/nexbitio/ndax.git
# Follow the README instructions
```

To build your own exchange you should now run QFinex as a backend instead of forking the repository,
and extend it using other microservices such as [QAuth](https://www.github.com/nexbitio/qauth).

## Mission

Our mission is to build an open-source crypto currency exchange with a high performance trading engine and incomparable security. We are moving toward dev/ops best practices of running an enterprise grade exchange.

We provide  on site training for installing, configuring and administration best practices of QFinex.
